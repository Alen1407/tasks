# Representing Text and Images

## Introduction
- Briefly introduce the importance of understanding how text and images are represented in computer architecture.
- Highlight the significance of characters, encoding schemes, color representation, and pixel-based images.

## Characters and the ASCII Table
### Characters and Text Representation
- Define characters as the basic building blocks of text representation in computers.
- Explain the need for character encoding to represent characters in binary form.

### ASCII Encoding
- Introduce the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) encoding scheme.
- Describe the ASCII table and how it maps characters to their corresponding binary representations.
- Illustrate examples of ASCII-encoded characters and their binary representations.

## Unicode
### The Limitations of ASCII
- Discuss the limitations of ASCII in representing characters from different languages and scripts.
- Highlight the need for a universal character encoding scheme.

### Introduction to Unicode
- Define Unicode as a character encoding standard that supports a wide range of characters.
- Explain how Unicode expands character representation using 16 or 32 bits.
- Discuss the advantages of Unicode in enabling multilingual text representation.

## Representing Colors
### Basics of Color Representation
- Introduce the concept of colors and their representation in digital systems.
- Explain the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model as a primary method for representing colors.

### Color Depth and Color Palettes
- Describe the concept of color depth (bit depth
